## Adult-Age Verification and Restriction

Javascript (underage) verification and restriction system (with local storage cookies) for websites that only adults are allowed to visit. 

The verification takes place when a user visits the website for the first time.

1. If the user confirms that they are of legal age, they will be redirected to the homepage of the website.

2. If the user does not confirm that they are of legal age, they will be blocked for a limited period of time. The time ban can be reset by the user to re-verify their age

It is useful for different types of websites:

- Online shops (products: alcohol, cigarettes, sex toys etc.)
- Blog websites with adult content
- All other websites with adult content
